# Mars Rover Simulator
This is a Java program that simulates the movement of a Mars rover on a map.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
To run this program, you will need:

* Java 8 or higher
* An IDE or text editor to view/edit the code (optional)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/mars-rover.git
```
2. Open the project in your IDE or text editor.

3. Run the Main class to start the program.

## Usage
When you run the program, a menu will be displayed with three exercises:

1. Exercise 1 - search in row
2. Exercise 2 - search in map
3. Exercises 3 and 4 - search with block
Choose the exercise you want to run by entering its number.

### Exercise 1 - search in row
This exercise simulates the movement of a Mars rover on a row. The rover starts at a given position and must reach a destination position on the same row. The program will display the map and move the rover one cell at a time until it reaches the destination position or reaches the end of the row.

### Exercise 2 - search in map
This exercise simulates the movement of a Mars rover on a map. The rover starts at a given position and must reach a destination position on the map. The program will display the map and move the rover one cell at a time until it reaches the destination position.

### Exercise 3 - search with block
This exercise is similar to exercise 2, but there are some blocked cells on the map that the rover cannot pass through. The program will display the map and move the rover one cell at a time until it reaches the destination position, avoiding the blocked cells.
